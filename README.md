# Ising Machines
This project is about Ising Machines, which are programs/devices which settle naturally to the ground state of a given Ising Hamiltonian. <Insert Equation Here> We attempt to create different Ising Machines and benchmark them versus classical heuristic methods like Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) Sampling Methods. At present, we have worked on MC Sampling (Python Code for the Number Partioning (NP-complete) and the Max-cut (NP-Complete) Problems) and an initial attempt at using GPUs for the same. 
# Coherent Ising Machines
The first physical Ising Machine we are implementing is a Coherent Ising Machine. We implement a setup along the lines of the work done in Bohm. et al. <Put link here>. We use an Opto-Electronic Oscillator (OEO), whose state naturally settles at or very near the optimum solution to the problem. Our Repository contains Python code for our simulation of the experiment. It also contains C-code which was used to program the FPGA used in our experimental setup.
